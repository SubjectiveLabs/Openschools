# Openschools
Subjective's commitment to **empowering** a deeper **school-student relationship** within education and organisation software, extends to **on and off** the Subjective platform.

We're helping **developers** create **better school-tailored** student software with our open source Openschools project.

Openschools makes our growing library of public school data and information on Subjective available for use in a JSON format.

_Currently the schools JSON includes:_
- School Name
- Week Bell Times (Monday - Friday)
- School Notices
- Links

## Usage
The Openschools JSON is available in the repository at `/schools.json`  or hosted online at https://cdn.subjective.school/schools.json

## Contribute
Openschools is the library of school data used for Subjective Discovery _(schools made publicly available on Subjective)_.

Help the Subjective and Openschools project by adding your school.

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Add your school to the `schools.json` file ensuring **all** required fields are included.

### Create

Adding your school to Openschools is easy with Subjective Assembly, our open-source live school data self-hosted API for Subjective.
Zero code, all done in a simple user interface.

Once school configuartion is completed in the Assembly interface, the created JSON in`/backend/static/school` can be added to the `schools.json` file.
 

3. Submit a detailed pull request with school name, and to ensure **only public data** is made available on Openschools, attach either a **link** to where the data was retrieved from or **written permission** from school executive staff.
