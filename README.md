# SubjectiveKit
Subjective's commitment to **empowering** a deeper **school-student relationship** within education and organisation software, extends to on and off the Subjective platform.

We're helping developers create **amazing school-tailored** student software with open-source data and tools we call **SubjectiveKit**.

SubjectiveKit includes a growing database of school data and school-themed seasonally updating messages, with more to come.
